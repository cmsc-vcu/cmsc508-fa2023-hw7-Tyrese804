Homework 7: Creating a database using DDL

This assignment includes a SQL file that is used to load tables and insert data into a database, as well as a qmd file with queries for the database. The biggest challenge I faced for this assignment was figuring out the correct queries to answer certain questions and getting the syntax right when adding data to SQL. I also had a little trouble connecting to the correct database to add my data to. This assignment has made me a lot more comfortable working with SQL, and will definitely help me for the project.
